              I grew up in the middle of the desert spending most of my time staring at a computer monitor. There isn't alot you can do when the tempurature is over 100Â°! While most of my first computers were plugged into a television set and had weird names like TRS, Commodore, and Macintosh, I was learning how to communicate with them. I guess you could say computing has always been a hobby of mine, and I have been very lucky to have witnessed "history in the making" out of shear luck and curiosity.
